        <p class="hero-subtitle">
          I moved to Hyde Park in 2023, right as I started grad school. 
          This became my block, my coffee runs, my late-night CVS trips, the route I walked so many times I stopped seeing it. 
          <br />
          But my friends started leaving, and I knew I'd have to leave eventually too. 
          So before I did, I wanted to see what this place looked like before I got here; and to remember what it looked like while I was still here.

          We've only walked a kilometer or so, but we jumped almost twenty years. All of us - everyone who's ever lived here - showed up somewhere in the middle, overlapped for a few years, and built our own version of 53rd before moving on.

          The street will keep changing. Valois will probably still be there. CVS will probably still come to the rescue at 3am. And wherever we end up in the world, this little strip of home will hold a version of us, frozen in time.
